# CommuniPy :snake: :books:
This repository includes exercises for refreshing Python skills, from strings, lists to Object Oriented Programming. 
* **It is also a place that values the human behind the screen and provides tips from other humans on real life matters. People with different backgrounds share their stories and advices on how to become a better programmer.**

* **This is intended to be a place for everyone with any Python knowledge to contribute
and make an impact within the community. Have a problem in mind or want to share your story? Make a pull request!**

**See [Notes](#notes) as to why test cases may be commented out.**

## How it works:
CommuniPy is a place to craft your Python skills and learn from a large community with valuable insights.
* Implementation happens in the source file (strings.py) within each Folder (e.g. 'Strings).
* After that, all you have to do is execute the test file. These have 'test_' at beginning of them.
* If you pass all tests no error will be thrown.
* If error is thrown it will trace back to the exact implementation where the error is coming from.
